# Delivery

A delivery service, also known as a delivery service, is a system that allows consumers to order and receive products or services directly to their homes or locations of choice, rather than physically visiting a store, restaurant or service provider. This business model offers customers convenience, saves time, and is often a convenient option for meeting shopping or dining needs.
